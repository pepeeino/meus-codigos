### CORS Handling

If you plan to use the Cloudflare cookie finder (`validate_site()`), you will need a **server** to bypass CORS restrictions. This is because browser-based requests may not allow cross-origin access to certain resources due to security policies.

### XSS-TESTER

xss-tester needs a lot of adjustments, mainly because I try to use js and python together, and as I don't know Python very well I used an AI for the codes, this could have caused a lot of confusion for me, which could have caused a lot of errors scripts, I also kind of forgot to add the part where you download your payloads file, this has to be added, I'll probably add it on Saturday

ps: if you want to help me with that there are my discord: bom_d_mais_ser_monogamico or pepeeino
